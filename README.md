# 2-configmaps

objectives:

1. take previous project, split nginx into seperate pods
  * use configmaps to do something, maybe to mount files instead of importing files into container
  * end up using base nginx container instead
2. something using secrets
  * webpage that shows select query from a mysql db?
3. use cronjobs to do something
  * backup of database?
